# My531
Android App for tracking progress and assist with gym workout sessions.

Notice:

The name My531 is a placeholder name and will be changed to something more appropriate upon the release of the first version.

The main project is in the GymBuddy folder.

Anything that is graphic related such as the image buttons in particular are placeholders. Once all the logic has been implemented to satisfy
the current sprint iteration they will be replaced as well as different color scheme.

Develop branch will always contain the most recent work within the current sprint not including unmerged(incomplete) features.

As of April 4, 2019 the master branch will only contain release versions of the program.


Plans for next release: 
Persistent Storage

Future Feature Plans:
Track each workout day idividually and store notes/statistics.

Control media playback through app
Settings to control how you want to use the app such as custom rest timers etc.
User accounts to allow you to easily see your statistics and import/export templates outside the app on a website interface
